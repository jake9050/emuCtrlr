This project is my personal Emu sampler Ctrlr panel.

The panel itself is useless without the following 3 components:

- an installation of the Ctrlr software - http://ctrlr.org for downloads and info/forum
- an Emu-systems EOS powered sampler
- a midi interface with the midi out and midi in connected tot the correct ports of said sampler.

It can be used with any Emu sampler running a form of the EOS operating system.
I am devving it using EOS v3.00b but it appears to be running smoothly on the later versions up to 4.7.

Also a big thank you to Roman Kubiak, the developer of the awesome, open-source and cross-platform Ctrlr software!
